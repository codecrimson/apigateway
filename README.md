This is not a standalone API gateway, but one that can be integrated into existing nodejs projects.

Detects api gateway path and calls appropriate subsystem and does a deep populate of external data as necessary depending on defined rules.

Extra code is included to support emailing notifications upon completion of the request (specific to project where this is being used).
